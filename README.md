## üåü Inspiration  

I've always loved playing games, and developing them. I've particularly enjoyed Google's Arts and Culture games for a while now, and what fascinates me about them is that they often teach you something in a fun way. \
One day, while browsing computer vision applications, I was introduced to the concept of neural style transfer ‚Äî a fascinating technique that blends different images to create an artistic result. This immediately caught my attention, and I thought: \
üí° "What if I could make a game around this?" \
I remembered Google's games, like _Say What You See, Un-Dough,_ and _Odd One Out_, where you or the system had to _guess_ something based on clues. I became inspired to craft an idea for a "reverse" style transfer game ‚Äî where the player must guess the original content and style images that created a given stylized output, and teach a thing or two along the way.

## üé® What is Style Transfer?  
**Neural Style Transfer (NST)** is a deep learning technique that applies the artistic style of one image to another image.  

For example, an AI can take a mountain landscape and transform it into a Van Gogh-style painting!

| **Content Image** | **Style Image** | **Stylized Output** |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| ![Content](https://aasraecotreks.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Island-Peak.jpg) | ![Style](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1280px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) | ![Stylized](https://i.ibb.co/HsbtQDp/Screenshot-2025-03-25-at-3-44-53-PM.png) |

A fundamental aspect of Style Transfer is that it preserves the content image - that is, you can still see the mountain in the result image above - but it transfers the style (such as the colors, strokes, and textures) of the style image, as you can also see in the result.

To further illustrate, notice how the bird is visible in the output, but painted very much like the style image?

Likewise, the cat here is maintained throughout the outputs but it's colored like the style images.

That's how Style Transfer looks. Pretty cool, right?

### How does it work?

---
This game uses a neural style transfer (NST) model implemented in PyTorch, based on the original work by Gatys et al. (2015). The core idea behind NST is to take two images‚Äîone content image (which provides the structure) and one style image (which provides the artistic texture)‚Äîand blend them together to create a new stylized image that retains the structure of the content while adopting the artistic patterns of the style.

**Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Feature Extraction with VGG-19**
   * The model loads a pre-trained VGG-19 convolutional neural network, a deep learning model originally trained on ImageNet.
   * Instead of using VGG-19 for classification, we extract feature maps from different layers to capture both content and style representations.

2. **Separating Content and Style**
   * The content image is passed through the network, and activations from a deeper layer (like `conv4_2`) are extracted. These contain the structural details of the image.
   * The style image is also passed through the network, but we extract activations from multiple layers (like `conv1_1`, `conv2_1`, etc.) to capture textures and artistic details.
   * A Gram matrix is computed for each style layer, which represents spatial correlations between features and helps define the "style" of an image.

3. **Optimization via Gradient Descent**
   * The algorithm starts with a copy of the content image (or random noise) and iteratively adjusts it to minimize two losses:
      * Content loss: Ensures the generated image remains structurally similar to the original content.
      * Style loss: Ensures the textures and patterns match the style image's characteristics.
   * These losses are optimized using an Adam optimizer, adjusting the pixel values in the stylized image to minimize the difference between the target and extracted features.

4. **Progressive Scaling for Better Quality**
   * Instead of directly generating a high-resolution output, the algorithm gradually refines the stylized image at multiple scales (starting from low-resolution and progressively increasing).
   * This improves consistency and avoids artifacts that arise when working with high-resolution images from the start.

5. **Final Output**
   * After 500+ iterations, the generated image reaches a visually appealing balance between content and style, resulting in a unique artistic transformation.

**Enhancements Used in This Model**

* **Pooling Adjustments:** Instead of only using max pooling, this implementation supports average and L2 pooling, affecting how textures are represented.
* **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Used to stabilize the optimization process by averaging intermediate results, reducing noise.
* **Regularization with TV Loss:** A total variation (TV) loss is applied to smooth out abrupt pixel transitions and reduce artifacts.
* **Style Loss via Wasserstein-2 Distance:** This implementation improves upon the original NST by using a Wasserstein-2 metric, which more effectively matches the style features across different scales.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Process  

### Data Exploration and Model Selection

The first step involved finding suitable image datasets for the style transfer model. I focused on paintings, landscapes, and cityscapes, as these categories are commonly used in style transfer and well-suited for the game concept. After searching on Kaggle, I found relevant, high-quality datasets containing thousands of images in these categories, totaling approximately 1.1 GB.

Next, I experimented with various style transfer implementations, including [TensorFlow's](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer) and [Pytorch's](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) tutorials, as well as open-source projects like [neural-style-transfer](https://pypi.org/project/neural-style-transfer/), [pastiche](https://pypi.org/project/pastiche/), [gordicaleksa's](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-neural-style-transfer), and [crowsonkb's](https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch). Crowsonkb's PyTorch-based implementation produced the most visually appealing blend of content and style, so I chose it for this project. The provided Jupyter Notebook also made experimentation easier.

### Style Transfer Model and Game Data

The core game concept is for the player to guess the original content and style images that were used to create the stylized output. Each round presents four image options: two correct (content and style) and two incorrect.

To implement this, I needed a way to generate stylized images and store them along with their source images. Because of storage limitations for the web front-end, I needed image URLs instead of saving images locally. I chose Cloudinary, a content delivery network that provides image URLs via an API. I then modified the style transfer model's cli.py file (the main command-line interface) as follows:

- Image Upload and URL Retrieval: Added a function to upload images to Cloudinary and retrieve their URLs for use in the front-end.

- Iteration Image Tracking: Added an iteration_image_urls attribute to the Callback class to store the URLs of the intermediate images generated during each iteration of the style transfer process. This allows for creating a visual "animation" of the style transfer.

- Modified save_image(): The save_image() function now saves the image to Cloudinary and appends the resulting URL to the iteration_image_urls list.

- Added Incorrect Image Arguments: Added command-line arguments for the two incorrect image options to be displayed in the game.

- write_to_json() Method: Created a write_to_json() function that retrieves the Cloudinary URLs for the content, style, and incorrect image options. It then organizes this data (content URL, style URL, incorrect option URLs, and the list of iteration_image_urls) into a dictionary, and saves this dictionary to a cloud-based JSON "basket" using GetPantry. This JSON file stores all the data needed for each round of the game. This function is called at the end of the script once the final image is created.

To generate data for the game, I created helper functions in the Jupyter Notebook to randomly select four unique images from the image datasets (content, style, and two incorrect options). Finally, I ran the modified style transfer script 150 times in a loop using the command line, resulting in a large JSON file containing the data for 150 game rounds.

### Front-end Interface Implementation

I started by sketching out how the UI should look and function. The main idea was simple: display a stylized image alongside four possible source images‚Äîtwo correct (content and style) and two incorrect. To make the interface intuitive, I positioned the stylized image on the left (occupying 30% of the screen) and arranged the image options in a grid on the right (covering 65%).

Early on, I also considered how to provide clear user feedback. Initially, I used a basic JavaScript alert popup to indicate whether a guess was correct or incorrect. While functional, it felt abrupt and lacked visual engagement. To test the core gameplay, I built a JavaScript prototype on PlayCode.io, which confirmed that my idea worked. With a solid foundation, I transitioned to refining and enhancing the experience.

To develop the final version, I chose ReactJS because of its component-based structure and state management capabilities, which helped efficiently track game progress, selections, and animations. The implementation process involved:

- Fetching Game Data: The JSON file stored all game data, with each entry containing a stylized image, its source images, incorrect options, and style transfer iteration images. I set up React state variables to load and manage this data dynamically.

- Structuring the UI: I created a responsive layout where the stylized image remained fixed on the left, while the image options dynamically updated in the grid on the right.

- User Feedback: I wanted to make things responsive to user interaction. Primarily, the user would select images and be notified if the guess was correct or incorrect, so providing feedback involved:
  - Hover Effects: Enlarged images slightly and thickened their borders. 
  - Selection Effects: Clicking an image applies a pressed-down animation and a blue border to confirm selection. This allows users to see what they chose.
  - Guess Checking: When two images are selected, the game checks if they were correct and lets the user know.
    - If they're correct, they're highlighted in green and a confetti effect drops from the top of the screen.
    - If they're incorrect, briefly shake and turn red before resetting. 
    - In either case, a message is displayed after guessing that says if the guess was correct or not.

- Visualizing the Process: To help players understand style transfer as a stepwise transformation, I included a process visualization feature. 
  - After a correct guess, the user can click to see how the stylized image was made.
  - The game briefly displays intermediate stylization steps between the content and final stylized image. These frames appear in a smooth transition, giving a clear visual of how the style is progressively applied. This adds an educational layer to the game while making correct guesses feel more rewarding.

- Scoring: I introduced a dynamic scoring system based on how quickly correct guesses were made, with the time ranges being 0-10 seconds, 10-20 seconds, and 20-30 seconds and the awarded points being 100, 50, and 20, respectively. I could've further granularized the time intervals for specific amounts of points, but I thought this would complicate things. However, green floating text briefly shows the points acquired after a correct guess, which is a fun little animation. 

- Timer: To encourage faster decision-making, I implemented a countdown timer as a vertical bar positioned between the stylized image and the image option grid, keeping it well in the user's focus. The timer starts at 30 seconds per round and visually depletes with time, and I set its color to reflect the urgency: green when there's 20-30 seconds left, yellow when there's 10-20 seconds left, and red for the final 10 seconds. After time runs out, the correct guesses are highlighted with a message saying as such. 

- Introduction Video: Since many players may not be familiar with style transfer, I created an intro video that explains the concept before gameplay. 
  - Essentially, I crafted a PowerPoint presentation that depicted what it is, some examples of it, and the game's basic rules, and recorded the slideshow. 
  - I embedded this video in the code, allowing users to close it to skip to the game, or watch it entirely before a Play button appears.  

- Help Menu: To provide quick access to instructions, I added a Help Menu, accessible via a question mark button at the top right. 
  - Clicking it pauses the game and opens a window, which can be closed to resume the game.
  - I decided to describe three things in the menu, namely:
    - How to Play ‚Äì Rules and mechanics, with an embedded demo video ("demo-play.mp4") showing a sample round.
    - What Style Transfer Is ‚Äì A brief explanation and depiction.
    - Credits ‚Äì Acknowledging the sources for the style transfer model and image datasets.

With these features in place, the game became intuitive, interactive, and educational. I think the combination of visual feedback, scoring mechanics, a timer, and helpful explanations make for an engaging experience while subtly teaching players about style transfer.
